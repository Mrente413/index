        <h2> RetroRenew: history/fun fact</h2>
        <p>Everything that we know is self taught and learned right from our own expierence. we struggled so you dont have to. Half the time when we service a device, the first step is q-tips, and 95% rubbing alcohol. 
            often times the batteries being left in over the decades is what leads to the death of the overall circut boards.</p>
        <p>originally created in 2021, the first product serviced was a 1997 gameboy color lime green, found in a savers store from Providence Rhode Island. Through word of mouth we have been able to assist in repairing
        and renewing several other gameboy color models, as well as advance, and advance sp models. Nintendo created about 100 million gameboy units worldwide in its release dating back to 1989 </p>

<h2>What we do:</h2>
	<img src="/photos/silver.jpg" alt="icon">
    <p>With the age of the products growing older and odler in tandem with the generation that used them, the need for repairs has increased and sourcing of components has skyrocketed. we source parts from places like ebay, second hand stores, and collectors</p>
    <p>We seek to provide Customers with an easy repair/procurment process. In addition to repairs we can perform upgrades to displays, hardware, etc. We also aim to build a community 
        that likes to preserve retro handheld or current gaming devices. Please feel free to share our website with any of your firends and family!</p>
