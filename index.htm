        <h2> RetroRenew: history/fun fact</h2>
        <p>Everything that we know is self taught and learned right from our own expierence. we struggled so you dont have to. Half the time when we service a device, the first step is q-tips, and 95% rubbing alcohol. 
            often times the batteries being left in over the decades is what leads to the death of the overall circut boards.</p>
        <p>originally created in 2021, the first product serviced was a 1997 gameboy color lime green, found in a savers store from Providence Rhode Island. Through word of mouth we have been able to assist in repairing
             and renewing several other gameboy color models, as well as advance, and advance sp models. Photos to come soon under our gallery. Nintendo created about 100 million gameboy units worldwide in its release dating back to 1989 </p>
