<hr>
<p>The Game Boy was a handheld video game console developed and manufactured by Nintendo, which was released in 1989. It became one of the most 
    popular and recognizable gaming devices of the 90s and was a major factor in the popularity of handheld gaming devices. The Game Boy was a 
    monochrome system with a green-tinted screen, and it was powered by a 4.19 MHz processor and 8 KB of RAM. It used cartridges to store games, 
    and was compatible with a wide range of titles, from classic franchises like "Super Mario Bros." and "The Legend of Zelda" to more niche offerings 
    like "Tetris" and "Kirby's Dream Land."
</p>
<p>The Game Boy was followed by several versions, including the Game Boy Pocket, the Game Boy Color, and the Game Boy Advance, each of which improved 
    upon the original design and added new features. Despite the release of more advanced systems, the original Game Boy remained popular and remained 
    in production until 2003, 14 years after its initial release. The legacy of the Game Boy can be seen in the continued popularity of handheld gaming
     devices, and its impact on the gaming industry is still felt today.
